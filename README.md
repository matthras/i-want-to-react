# I want to: React

## Aim

To teach myself React by building a ton of very small projects that individually demonstrate one React concept at a time.

## Conditions

* Every project is a single file that can be opened locally.
* Every project must be written with just enough code to demonstrate the concept.
* Minimal or no CSS, unless it is to demonstrate a React concept.

## Why?

* I want a central place where I can go to, identify exactly what I want, and immediately understand how to do it from looking at a simple example.
* I learn best from reverse-engineering examples and figuring out how things work, THEN confirming with or referring to the theory when stuck.
* I hate video tutorials because I visually process information much faster than listening to someone's voice.
* It's frustrating to google something and plow through unhelpful Stackexchange posts.

## Menu

I want to:

0. understand how to load React & Babel in the front-end - template.html
1. write 'Hello World' in React in the simplest way possible - helloworld.html
2. understand props - props.html
