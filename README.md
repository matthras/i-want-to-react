# I want to: React

## Aim

To teach myself React by building a ton of very small projects that individually demonstrate one React concept at a time.

## Conditions

* Every project is a single file that can be opened locally.
* Every project must be written with just enough code to demonstrate the concept.
* Minimal or no CSS, unless it is to demonstrate a React concept.

## Why?

* I learn best from examples. I hate video tutorials and sometimes it's frustrating to google something and plow through unhelpful Stackexchange posts.

## Menu

I want to:

1. write 'Hello World' in React in the simplest way possible - helloworld.html
2. understand 'props' - props.html
