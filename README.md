# I want to: React

## Aim

To teach myself React by building a ton of very small projects that individually demonstrate one React concept at a time. The end goal is a central repository of React resources that consist of 'building blocks' for React which contains modular and reusable code.

## Conditions

* Every project is a single HTML file that can be downloaded and opened locally.
* Must use CDNs for JS/CSS libraries.
* Every project must be written with just enough code to demonstrate the concept.
* Minimal or no CSS, unless it is to demonstrate a React concept.
* If there is more than one way to perform a certain task, the simplest and most readable should be featured. By the time you're a React expert, you'll know better.
* Stick to ES2015 syntax when possible (currently not a priority as I'm not familiar with all features)

## Why?

* I want a central place where I can go to, identify exactly what I want, and immediately understand how to do it from looking at a simple example.
* I learn best from reverse-engineering examples and figuring out how things work, THEN confirming with or referring to the theory when stuck.
* I hate video tutorials because I visually process information much faster than listening to someone's voice.

## Menu

I want to:

0. understand how to load React & Babel in the front-end - template.html
1. write 'Hello World' in React in the simplest way possible - helloworld.html
2. understand props - props.html

__Event Handling__

* change text on button upon clicking button (from Facebook's React Tutorial) - buttonclick.html
* change text upon clicking other text - textclick.html

__Uncategorised__

* make an API call using jQuery, bind the results to state and output a list of Star Wars movies - apicallbind.html
* build a markdown previewer - markdownpreviewer.html

**To Do**

* understand state
* pass data from parent state to child components
* understand componentDidMount, componentWillMount, etc.
* handle events - on change, on mousemove, etc.

Breaking down FCC Camper Leaderboard Task
* make an API call using fetch/jQuery, and bind the results to state (Q: How to check if successful?)
* manipulating API data into a list
* manipulate API data into a table

Breaking down the FCC Markdown Previewer Task
* type text into a textbox, and have it appear as is in another section
