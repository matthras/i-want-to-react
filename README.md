# I want to: React

## Aim

To teach myself React by building a ton of very small projects that individually demonstrate one React concept at a time.

## Conditions

* Every project is a single file that can be opened locally.
* Every project must be written with just enough code to demonstrate the concept.
* Minimal or no CSS, unless it is to demonstrate a React concept.

## Why?

* I want a central place where I can go to, identify exactly what I want, and immediately understand how to do it from looking at a simple example.
* I learn best from reverse-engineering examples and figuring out how things work, THEN confirming with or referring to the theory when stuck.
* I hate video tutorials because I visually process information much faster than listening to someone's voice.
* It's frustrating to google something and plow through unhelpful Stackexchange posts.

## Menu

I want to:

0. understand how to load React & Babel in the front-end - template.html
1. write 'Hello World' in React in the simplest way possible - helloworld.html
2. understand props - props.html

* make an API call using jQuery, bind the results to state and output a list of Star Wars movies - apicallbind.html
* build a markdown previewer - markdownpreviewer.html

**To Do**

* understand state
* pass data from parent state to child components
* understand componentDidMount, componentWillMount, etc.
* handle events - click of a button, on change, on mousemove, etc.

* make an API call using fetch/jQuery, and bind the results to state (Q: How to check if successful?)
* manipulating API data into a list
* manipulate API data into a table

Breaking down the FCC Markdown Previewer Task
* type text into a textbox, and have it appear as is in another section
